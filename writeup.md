## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

The most common sentiment observed in my sample of 50 reviews is negative. 

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

Not all of the reviews were labeled accurately. There were also more sentiments labeled than there were reviews. Running the program again also resulted in different sentiments ratios despite having the same prompt. Model hallucinations will result in an inaccurate analysis on the reviews.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

The most common sentiment is negative. There are several reviews that expressed that the previous packaging and formula was better. The business can improve their product and satisfaction by bringing back the boxed packaging and old formula.
